# A sample graph file in the SNAP format (.gr extension)
# (lines beginning with a # symbol indicate comments)

# p denotes the problem line
# p <n> <m> <undirected/directed> <weight_type> <0 or 1-indexed>

# n indicates the number of vertices.

# m denotes the number of edges.

# The third parameter can be either u denoting a undirected graph, 
# or d denoting a directed graph. Internally, an edge <u, v> in an 
# undirected graph is stored as two directed links u->v and v->u.

# weight_type can be u (unweighted), i (integer), l (long, 8 bytes on 64-bit
# architectures), f (float), or d (double)

# For the fifth parameter, 0 indicates that the valid range of vertex IDs
# is 0 to n-1. 1 indicates that it is 1 to n.

# The problem line is followed by a listing on exactly m edges. The format
# is <u v w> for a weighted graph, and <u v> for an unweighted graph.
