# A sample configuration file for generating random graphs
# (lines beginning with a # symbol indicate comments)

# The number of vertices is given by n
n 100000

# The number of edges is denoted by m
m 1000000

# Set undirected to 1 for a undirected graph, 0 otherwise
undirected 1

# Edge weights: 0 for unweighted, 1 for integer weight, 2 for long weights
#               3 for floats, 4 for doubles
weight_type 0

# Max edge weight
# max_weight 100

# Min edge weight
# min_weight 0
