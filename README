SNAP: Small-world Network Analysis and Partitioning
version 0.4

SNAP (Small-world Network Analysis and Partitioning) is an extensible parallel
framework for exploratory analysis and partitioning of large-scale networks.

SNAP is implemented in C, uses OpenMP primitives for parallelization, and
targets sequential, multicore, and symmetric multiprocessor platforms. Our
intent with SNAP is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for network
analysis and application design, hiding the parallel programming complexity
from the user. In addition to path-based, centrality, and community
identification queries on large-scale graphs, we support commonly-used
preprocessing kernels and quantitative measures that help understand the
global network topology.

Please refer to the SNAP user guide 
(http://snap-graph.sourceforge.net/snap_user_guide.pdf) for installation 
instructions.
