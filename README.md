# snap-graph

SNAP is an extensible parallel framework for exploratory analysis and
partitioning of large-scale networks. SNAP is implemented in C, uses
OpenMP primitives for parallelization, and targets sequential,
multicore, and symmetric multiprocessor platforms. Our intent with
SNAP is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for network
analysis and application design, hiding the parallel programming
complexity from the user. In addition to path-based, centrality, and
community identification queries on large-scale graphs, we support
commonly-used preprocessing kernels and quantitative measures that
help understand the global network topology.
