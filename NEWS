[Aug 31, 2009] Updating SVN repository with new community greedy agglomerative
               community identification algorithms.

[May 25, 2009] Our IPDPS 2009 paper discusses new data structures and
               parallel algorithms for dynamic network analysis.

[Apr 03, 2009] SNAP 0.3 has been released. Several bugs have been
               fixed, and the interface has been cleaned up. Updates 
               include data structures and traversal algorithms for dynamic 
               network analysis.

[May 05, 2008] SNAP 0.2 is now available. This version includes a
               new parallel community identification implementation based on
               Newman's recursive spectral partitioning algorithm.
               
[Feb 12, 2008] SNAP 0.1 is available for download. This is the first SourceForge 
               release.

[Feb 12, 2008] Our IPDPS 2008 paper presents an overview of SNAP and new 
               parallel community identification approaches. Slides on SNAP and 
               a draft user guide have also been posted online.
